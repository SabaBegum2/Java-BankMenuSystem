# Java-BankMenuSystem

Welcome to Java-BankMenuSystem, a Java project designed to simulate a menu-driven interface for basic banking operations.
This repository features a Menu class that encapsulates the functionality of a simple console-based menu system, offering a 
selection of options for hypothetical banking operations.

Key Features:

User-Friendly Menu Interface: The Menu class provides an easy-to-navigate menu for users, displaying options for various banking operations.

Customizable Messages: Includes methods for setting custom welcome and goodbye messages, enhancing user interaction.

Dynamic Menu Options: Demonstrates the use of arrays to store and display menu items, with flexibility to modify or extend menu options.

Menu Choice Handling: Implements a method to handle user inputs and provide appropriate responses or actions based on the selection.

Educational Value: Ideal for beginners in Java, teaching basic concepts such as class design, arrays, and user input handling in a practical, real-world context.

Expandable Framework: The repository is set up to allow easy addition of functionalities corresponding to each menu option, inviting contributions for further development.

Java-BankMenuSystem is a perfect starting point for those looking to understand how menu-driven applications are structured and developed in Java. It's a practical 
example of how to implement basic user interaction in a console application. Join us in enhancing and expanding this simple yet effective banking menu system!
